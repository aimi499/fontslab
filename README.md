# fontslab
This is a project exploring the expression of fonts. Inspired by a #100daysdesignchallenge project by S.F. based designer Do-Hee Kim(http://100daysoffonts.com/). I am also using the framework of Do-Hee Kim's work to kick off my project quickly. I am still learning and will update my framework in the future. Hope I could update everyday.
